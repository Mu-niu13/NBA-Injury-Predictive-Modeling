# NBA Injury Predictive Modeling Project

## Overview
This repository contains the code for the capstone project conducted by the [UC Santa Barbara Data Science Initiative](https://datascience.ucsb.edu/)
in collaboration with [Peak Performance Project (P3)](https://www.p3.md/).
This project seeks to deepen our understanding of the mechanisms behind prevalent injuries within the NBA,
specifically targeting back and hamstring injuries, and to enhance predictive capabilities to mitigate their occurrence.
By combining biomechanical data with injury patterns, the study aims to identify preventive measures and develop a machine
learning model using XGBoost for predicting these injuries based on biomechanical data.


## Project Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

- `web-scraping.ipynb`: Notebook illustrating the data collection process from [Pro Sports Transaction](https://prosportstransactions.com/).
- `data_cleaning.ipynb`: Notebook containing the data cleaning and preprocessing steps.
- `modeling.ipynb`: Notebook dedicated to the feature selection, modeling phase, including training and evaluation of models.


## Data
The data used in this project is owned by P3 and is subject to a non-disclosure agreement. Therefore, the datasets are not publicly available in this repository.

## Tools and Technologies
- Python: Primary programming language used.
- Jupyter Notebook: Used for executing data science workflows.
- Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, xgboost etc.

## Acknowledgments
I hereby express my deepest gratitude to UCSB and P3 for their invaluable guidance and support throughout this project.
Special thanks to P3 for sponsoring the project and providing the data essential for our research.
